# Question 1

The manager of a URL commercial address is interested in predicting the number of
megabytes downloaded, `megasd`, by clients according to the number of minutes they are connected, `mconnected`. The manager randomly selects (megabyte, minute) pairs, records the data, and stores the pairs (`megasd`, `mconnected`) in the file `URLADDRESS`.

(a) Create a scatterplot of the data. Characterize the relationship between `megasd` and `mconnected`.

(b) Fit a regression line to the data. Superimpose the resulting line in the plot created in part (a).

(c) Compute the covariance matrix of the $\hat{\beta}$s.

(d) What is the standard error of $\hat{\beta_1}$?

(e) What is the covariance between $\hat{\beta_0}$ and $\hat{\beta_1}$?

(f) Construct a 95% confidence interval for the slope of the regression line.

(g) Compute $R^2$, $R^2_a$, and the residual variance for the fitted regression.

# Question 2

A story by James R. Hagerty entitled *With Buyers Sidelined, Home Prices Slide* published in the Thursday October 25, 2007 edition of the *Wall Street Journal* contained data on so-called fundamental housing indicators in major real estate markets across the US. The author argues that "*... prices are generally falling and overdue loan payments are piling up*". Thus, we shall consider data presented in the article on 

$Y$ = Percentage change in average price from July 2006 to July 2007 (based on the S&P/Case-Shiller national housing index); and 

$x$ = Percentage of mortgage loans 30 days or more overdue in latest quarter (based on data from Equifax and Moodyâ€™s). 

The data are available in the file *indicators.txt*. 

Fit the following model to the data:
$$Y=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x+\varepsilon.$$ 
Complete the following tasks: 

(a) Find a 95% confidence interval for the slope of the regression model. On the basis of this confidence interval decide whether there is evidence of a significant negative linear association.

(b) Use the fitted regression model to estimate ${\rm E}(Y|x=4)$. Find a 95% confidence interval for ${\rm E}(Y|x=4)$. Is 0% a feasible value for ${\rm E}(Y|x=4)$? Give a reason to support your answer.
